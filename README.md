# Calculator Project
* Basic calculator with click support
* Shows all numbers on display. (Can currently overflow display)

##  Refactoring opportunities/needs
* Break compute into smaller reusable functions
* May need to change input method from collecting into a single string to pushing to array to allow improved implementation of functions

## Improvements
* Prevent display overflow
* Add keyboard support
* Pretty it up

## Improvements made
* Added hover effect to buttons
* Removed issue with trailing operator
* Added decimal ability with only one allowed in each number
* Added backspace button to correct errors
